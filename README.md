# Monte Carlo Simulation in Company Valuation

To minimize the downside of the assumptions made in an intrinsic valuation approach, the possibility exists to model the risk via a monte carol simulation. Each variable in the model that is derived through assumption can be stochastically modelled. The main purpose of a monte carlo in the context of a valuation is to achieve a risk management component, by integrating the expected value of multiple parameter outcomes. The two main approaches of risk management in valuation are either via a tree-based or simulation approach. The advantages of using simulations instead of decision-trees is that the flexibilty of not only choosing a binary input approach, but instead choosing an underlying distribution. The first-step in the simulation is assigning a distribution of the variable, either through historical data, most likey outcome or market consensus. After the distributions are assigned, a single value of each parameter distribution gets sampled and the dcf-valuation is done either via a FCFF or FCFE as per usual.
