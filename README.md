# Monte Carlo Simulation in Company Valuation

To minimize the downside of the assumptions made in an intrinsic valuation approach, the possibility exists to model the risk via a monte carol simulation. Each variable in the model that is derived through assumptions that can be stochastically modelled via an assumed distribution. The main purpose of a monte carol in the context of a valuation is to achieve risk management, by integrating the expected value of multiple parameter outcomes. The two main approaches of risk management in valuation are using tree-based approach and simulation approches. The advantages of using simulatin instead of decision-trees is that the flexibilty of choosing not only a binary approach. The first-step in the simulation is assigning a distribution of the variable, either through historical data, most likey outcome or market consensus. After the distributions are assigned, a single value of each parameter distribution gets chosen and the dcf-valuation is done as per usual.
